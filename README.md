<h2> :book:Introduction</h2>
The purpose of this case study is to offer another illustration of market segmentation
analysis using a different empirical data set.
This data set was collected originally for the purpose of comparing the validity
of a range of different answer formats in survey research investigating brand image.
Descriptions of the data are available in Dolnicar and Leisch (2012), Dolnicar and
Grün (2014), and Grün and Dolnicar (2016). Package MSA contains the sections of
the data used in this case study.
For this case study, imagine that you are McDonald’s, and you would want
to know if consumer segments exist that have a distinctly different image of
McDonald’s. Understanding such systematic differences of brand perceptions by
market segments informs which market segments to focus on, and what messages to
communicate to them. We can choose to focus on market segments with a positive
perception, and strengthen the positive perception. Or we can choose to focus on a
market segment that currently perceives McDonald’s in a negative way. In this case,
we want to understand the key drivers of the negative perception, and modify them.

<h2> :book:Data Description</h2>
The data set contains responses from 1453 adult Australian consumers relating to
their perceptions of McDonald’s with respect to the following attributes: YUMMY,
CONVENIENT, SPICY, FATTENING, GREASY, FAST, CHEAP, TASTY, EXPENSIVE,
HEALTHY, and DISGUSTING. These attributes emerged from a qualitative study conducted in preparation of the survey study. For each of those attributes, respondents
provided either a YES response (indicating that they feel McDonald’s possesses
this attribute), or a NO response (indicating that McDonald’s does not possess this
attribute).

<h2> :book:Conclusion</h2>
After the market segmentation analysis is completed, and all strategic and tactical
marketing activities have been undertaken, the success of the market segmentation
strategy has to be evaluated, and the market must be carefully monitored on a
continuous basis. It is possible, for example, that members of segment 3 start earning
more money and the MCSUPERBUDGET line is no longer suitable for them. Changes
can occur within existing market segments. But changes can also occur in the
larger marketplace, for example, if new competitors enter the market. All potential
sources of change have to be monitored in order to detect changes which require
McDonald’s management to adjust their strategic or tactical marketing in view of
new market circumstances
